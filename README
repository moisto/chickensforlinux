----------- FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS -----------
--------------------------------------------------

1) What is Level Mode?
	Answer: Level Mode is where you play increasingly difficult
   levels. The higher the level number, the faster the chickens run
   and the more you need to kill. Each level always begins with 60
   seconds on the clock. The scoring format differs from Classic 
   Mode, judging your skill via Accuracy. Some colored gems offer 
   rewards different from the Classic Mode.
	Red:	+3 seconds
	Green:	+5 rocket radius
	Blue:	+1 second

   Accuracy is determined with this far-less-than-perfect equation:
	accuracy = 70(kills / shots_fired) + 30(timer / 60)

	You will be awarded green floating bonus points if your
	accuracy exceeds 100%

   Keep in mind you lose an additional second each time you shoot!

   You cannot "win" in Level Mode. There is no last level. That
   means this game has infinite replay value, because you can
   NEVER beat it! Hurrah!


2) What is Classic Mode?

	Answer: Classic Mode is the type of gameplay of the original
   chickens game. It does have a few enhancements such as the shotgun
   and more gem bonuses, but the mindset is the same. You are on a
   2-minute timer, and you mustn't let any chicken run or fly to the
   opposite side of your screen. When this happens, you die die DIE. 

   Each time you shoot, you lose an additional second. "Group them 
   and blow the shit out of them," I used to say.

3) How can I use a different High-Score name?

	Answer: ./chickens -name your_name


4) How do I change the configuration file?

	Answer: Just open 'options.cfg' in your favorite text editor. I
   made comments about each variable, so enjoy.


5) The chickens are running wicked fast! Why?

	Answer: It's more exciting.


6) Dude, what's with the Tenderizer sound effect?

	Answer: Umm...Three? I'm not sure what you mean.


7) How do I use the shotgun?

	Answer: Right-click the mouse.


8) So with rockets only the 'X' mouse coordinate matters?

	Answer: Yes. This ain't no bug. This was the best way for me to
   implement the shotgun. The original Chickens game lets you shoot beneath
   the ground the same way (but there's no 2nd weapon)...


9) What features can I expect from the next version?

	Answer: 
   A more polished Level Mode.
   HighScore support for Level Mode
   Chickens that fly towards you.
   Maybe a better Tenderizer sound, too.
